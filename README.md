### About

I created a twitter bot to catalogue ownership disclosures using the news-api, tweepy and traditional web scraping practices. Its developed in Python. I've deployed the application via Google's cloud functions platform for serverless operation. The bot tweets daily with a repeating cronjob.

Also there is some other stuff in here for a medium post im doing about the primaries that im too lazy to make another repo for. but i think you can follow the clues.

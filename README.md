### About

I created a twitter bot to catalogue ownership disclosures using the news-api, tweepy and traditional web scraping practices. Its developed in Python. I've deployed the application via Google's cloud functions platform for serverless operation. The bot tweets daily with a repeating cronjob.

Also there is some other python work in here for various side projects -- i'm tired of jumping back and forth bt directories to tweak files so i'm just putting them all in here. the more the merrier!

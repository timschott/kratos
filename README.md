### About

Growing up in Virginia, *The Washington Post* has always been a mainstay on my family's kitchen table. I couldn't help but laugh a few years back when they were acquired by ultra-tycoon Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon. 

As part of their unflinching committment to journalistic integrity, *Washington Post* journalists are obliged to disclose Bezos' ownership whenever a story involves Amazon or their holdings (such as, but not limited to: Audible, Goodreads, Ring, Twitch, Whole Foods as well as the dizzying array of Amazon sub-brands such as [America's leading provider of distributed cloud computing] Amazon Web services, Amazon Fresh, Amazon Prime and Amazon Science).

I created a twitter bot to catalogue these divulgences using the news-api, tweepy and traditional web scraping practices. Its developed in Python. I've deployed the application via Google's cloud functions platform for serverless operation. The bot tweets daily with a repeating cronjob.

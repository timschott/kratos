### About

I created a twitter bot to catalogue ownership disclosures using the news-api, tweepy and traditional web scraping practices. Its developed in Python. I've deployed the application via Google's cloud functions platform for serverless operation. The bot pings the washington post every hour for potential updates via a cron-job (this typically produces a new post every other day).

Also there is some other python work in this repo for various side projects -- i'm tired of jumping back and forth bt directories to tweak files so i'm just putting them all in here. the more the merrier!
